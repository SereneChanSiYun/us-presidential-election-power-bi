# Power BI Project: U.S. Presidential Elections 
This project aims to explore insights and tell a story from an interactive Power BI dashboard through analyzing the U.S. Presidential elections so far in the 21st century from year 2000 to 2024. Source of data is from official state election data records.

This repository contains all documents of the project, including:
- [Power BI Dashboard](US_election_power_bi_dashboard.pbix) for visualisation
- [Dataset](countypres_2000-2024.xlsx)

The dashboard is divided into 4 levels: National level, State level, County level and Swing States.
